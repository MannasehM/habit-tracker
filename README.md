# habit-tracker

I want to build a website where I can add habits and remove habits limitlessly. 
For each habit, I will have a heat map (basically like the github contribution graph).

1. I need to create the basic structure first in Java. 
2. Then I will need to implement that code in a website. 
3. Then we can make that website into an app (optional)

Ideas: 
- The list of habits you have can be represented as an ArrayList where you can freely add or remove habits. 
- Create a Habit class/object where we can define certain private instance variables such as a title, description, why (the reason for building the habit), and count variable
- Somehow we have to store the habits the user wants to keep track of between program runs so that the user doesn't have to enter them all the time. The habits should also contain how many consecutive days the habit was checked off and how many in total it was checked off in all time. 

First create a basic implementation in Java
